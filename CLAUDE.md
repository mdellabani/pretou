# Rural Community Platform

SaaS platform for small French communes (<2,000 inhabitants). Combines community interaction, official municipal communication, and mairie back-office tools in one product. Targets rural France where adoption depends on App Store presence and simplicity.

## Architecture

Monorepo with two frontend apps sharing a common backend and TypeScript package.

```
apps/web/       — Next.js 15 (App Router) — commune public website (SSR/SEO) + desktop admin panel
apps/mobile/    — Expo (React Native) — resident app + field admin for mairie workers
packages/shared — TypeScript types, Supabase queries (platform-agnostic), Zod validation, constants
supabase/       — Postgres schema, RLS policies, Edge Functions, migrations
```

Feature scope and business context: `design.md`

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Web | Next.js 15, App Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| Mobile | Expo, Expo Router, React Native |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions) |
| Geo | PostGIS (Supabase extension) |
| Shared | TypeScript, Zod |
| Monorepo | Turborepo + pnpm workspaces |
| Deploy | Vercel (web), EAS (mobile), Supabase Cloud |

## Build / Dev Commands

```bash
pnpm install                                        # install all dependencies
npx supabase start                                   # start local Supabase (Docker)
npx supabase db reset                                # apply migrations + seed (idempotent)
pnpm --filter @rural-community-platform/web dev      # web app → http://localhost:3000
cd apps/mobile && npx expo start --clear             # mobile app (Expo Go)
npx supabase stop                                    # stop local Supabase
```

## Key Conventions

- **Multi-tenancy:** every tenant-scoped table has `commune_id`. Security enforced via Supabase RLS, not app code.
- **Shared queries:** data-fetching functions live in `packages/shared`, accept a Supabase client param. No platform-specific code in shared.
- **No UI sharing:** web uses `<div>` + Tailwind, mobile uses `<View>` + StyleSheet. The screens serve different purposes — don't force shared components.
- **One write, multiple outputs:** admin posts once -> appears on mobile feed (Realtime), commune website (SSR), and triggers push notification (Edge Function).
- **French context:** UI labels, error messages, and content are in French. Code (variable names, comments) stays in English.
- **Roles:** `resident < moderator < admin`. Use `is_commune_moderator()` for moderation RLS, `is_commune_admin()` for admin-only.
- **Post types:** `annonce` (admin only), `evenement`, `entraide`, `discussion`, `service` (7-day auto-expiry).
- **Feed pagination:** cursor-based (`created_at`), 20 posts/page, pinned posts loaded separately.
- **Moderation:** posts have `is_hidden` column. Reports auto-hide at 3 flags. Word filter auto-hides on match. All actions logged in `audit_log`.

## Database Schema

4 migrations in `supabase/migrations/`:
- `001_initial_schema.sql` — communes, profiles, posts, comments, rsvps, RLS, helper functions
- `002_design_fields.sql` — theme, motto, description fields on communes
- `003_features_v2.sql` — service posts (expires_at), producers, polls (poll_options, poll_votes)
- `004_moderation.sql` — reports, audit_log, word_filters, moderator role, is_hidden, auto-hide trigger

## Environment Variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=       # server-side only, never exposed to client
```

## Current Status

- **v1 ~90%**: auth, feed (paginated), post detail, events (calendar), mon espace, infos pratiques (redesigned), admin panel, public commune site
- **v2 ~90%**: service posts, polls, producers directory, reporting, moderator role, word filter, rate limiting, audit log
- **Remaining**: push notifications, password reset, image upload, alertes tab, commune onboarding UI, map view
